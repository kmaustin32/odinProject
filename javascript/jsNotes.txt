Javascript Primitives

Variables:
    let (and var, technically): This is the general way to declare a variable. 
    const: These are for immutable variables, like the hex of a color or the amount of time to load page. 
        names for const: Do all CAPS for variables that were known before like color.
            Use camelCase for those unknown, like normal var.

Javascript Primitives:
Numbers:
    These are normal numbers that basic operations can be performed on. This includes BOTH INTEGERS AND FLOATS.
    There are special Numbers that get their own names. 
        NaN (Not a Number), Infinity, and -Infinity.
        NaN is basically a failed computation. If NaN is present anywhere in a math formula, the result will also be NaN, with the exception being NaN ** 0 = 1

BigInt:
    JS doesn't have the space to store integers larger than (2^53-1) (thatâ€™s 9007199254740991), or less than -(2^53-1) for negatives.
    Adding a n to the end of an integer will make it a BigInt. 

Strings:
    Strings are characters between 'quotes', "double quotes", or `backticks`.
    Remember template strings? Use backticks to embed variables in a string. `Hello ${varName}, Welcome back!` is a good example.

Booleans:
    These are basically true or false. 

null:
    This is just a falsey nothing. Nothing or empty. 

undefined:
    Basically means that a value is not assigned. For example if I don't say let name = "Ezra" but call name, it will be undefined. 

Objects and Symbols:
