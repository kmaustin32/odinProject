Variables:
    let (and var, technically): This is the general way to declare a variable. 
    const: These are for immutable variables, like the hex of a color or the amount of time to load page. 
        names for const: Do all CAPS for variables that were known before like color.
                            Use camelCase for those unknown, like normal var.

Javascript Primitives:
Numbers:
    These are normal numbers that basic operations can be performed on. This includes BOTH INTEGERS AND FLOATS.
    There are special Numbers that get their own names. 
        NaN (Not a Number), Infinity, and -Infinity.
        NaN is basically a failed computation. If NaN is present anywhere in a math formula, the result will also be NaN, with the exception being NaN ** 0 = 1

BigInt:
    JS doesn't have the space to store integers larger than (2^53-1) (thatâ€™s 9007199254740991), or less than -(2^53-1) for negatives.
    Adding a n to the end of an integer will make it a BigInt.
