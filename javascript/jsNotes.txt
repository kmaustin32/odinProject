Variables:
    let (and var, technically): This is the general way to declare a variable. 
    const: These are for immutable variables, like the hex of a color or the amount of time to load page. 
        names for const: Do all CAPS for variables that were known before like color.
                            Use camelCase for those unknown, like normal var.
